## How to Play

- Once you have the game opened and ready to go, you can start by choosing whether to play against another player or an AI.
- If you chose to play against the AI you will be given 3 difficults to pick from.
- After choosing your opponent, a 15 by 15 game board will appear that will begin with player 1 (black peices) going first.
- The players will now take turns placing thier coloured peices (black and white) on empty intersections in hopes of getting 5 or more in a row to be victorious.
- This row can be either vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
- Throughout the game the position for latest piece placed for each player along with which player's turn it is will be displayed on the right hand side of game board.  
- The options to reset the game and undo a turn are also located on the right side of the board.
- After a player has obtained 5 or more in a row the game will end with a victory box displaying the winner and the winning 5 pieces.
